# Unsupervised Clustering

This repository contains a Shiny [user interface](https://github.com/aalvarogaarcia/TFM/blob/main/UI/user-interface.md) and an [R Markdown](https://github.com/aalvarogaarcia/TFM/tree/main/RMD/RMD.md) report for unsupervised clustering for endophenotype discovery in genetic and proteomics data. 
The project was developed as part of a Master's thesis in Bioinformatics and biostatistics from UOC-UB in collaboration with the Genomics Division of the Institute of Technology and Renewable Energy (https://www.iter.es/areas/area-genomica/).

## Objective

The main objective of this project was to develop a user-friendly tool for exploring and analyzing genetic and protein data using unsupervised clustering techniques. 
The tool should allow users to:

* Perform univariate and bivariate analysis of genetic and protein data.
* Conduct multivariate analysis to identify endotypes using various clustering algorithms.
* Visualize the results of the clustering analysis using different visualization techniques.


## Methodology

The project was developed using R and Shiny. The Shiny user interface provides a user-friendly way to interact with the data and perform the analysis. 
The R Markdown report provides a detailed overview of the methodology and results.

### Key Features:

* Interactive Shiny user interface: The Shiny user interface allows users to easily upload data, select clustering algorithms and visualization techniques, and view the results of the analysis.
* Comprehensive R Markdown report: The R Markdown report provides a detailed overview of the methodology, including data preprocessing, clustering analysis, and visualization.
* Multiple R Scripts: In these scripts a whole series of methods and functions are developed with different objectives for the analysis and visualization of data.

## Target Audience:

 This tool is intended for researchers and students in the fields of bioinformatics, genetics, and genomics who are interested in analyzing genetic and protein data using unsupervised clustering techniques.

## Disclaimer:

 This tool is for research purposes only and should not be used for clinical diagnosis or treatment.

## Next Steps:

 Future work could include:

* Extending the tool to support additional data types.
* Developing more advanced visualization techniques.
* Integrating the tool with other bioinformatics tools.
