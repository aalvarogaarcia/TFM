# Unsupervised Clustering

This repository contains a Shiny [user interface](https://github.com/aalvarogaarcia/TFM/blob/main/UI/user-interface.md) and an [R Markdown](https://github.com/aalvarogaarcia/TFM/tree/main/RMD/RMD.md) report for unsupervised clustering for endophenotype discovery in genetic and proteomics data. 
The project was developed as part of a Master's thesis in Bioinformatics and biostatistics from UOC-UB in collaboration with the Genomics Division of the Institute of Technology and Renewable Energy (https://www.iter.es/areas/area-genomica/).

## Objective

The main objective of this project was to develop a user-friendly tool for exploring and analyzing genetic and protein data using unsupervised clustering techniques. 
The tool should allow users to:

* Perform univariate and bivariate analysis of genetic and protein data.
* Conduct multivariate analysis to identify endotypes using various clustering algorithms.
* Visualize the results of the clustering analysis using different visualization techniques.


## Methodology

The project was developed using R and Shiny. The Shiny user interface provides a user-friendly way to interact with the data and perform the analysis. 
The R Markdown report provides a detailed overview of the methodology and results.

### Key Features:

* Interactive Shiny user interface: The Shiny user interface allows users to easily upload data, select clustering algorithms and visualization techniques, and view the results of the analysis. [Instructions](RMD/RMD.md) 
* Comprehensive R Markdown report: The R Markdown report provides a detailed overview of the methodology, including data preprocessing, clustering analysis, and visualization. [Instructions](UI/UI.md)
* Multiple R Scripts: In these scripts a whole series of methods and functions are developed with different objectives for the analysis and visualization of data.

## Target Audience:

 This tool is intended for researchers and students in the fields of bioinformatics, genetics, and genomics who are interested in analyzing genetic and protein data using unsupervised clustering techniques.

## Disclaimer:

 This tool is for research purposes only and should not be used for clinical diagnosis or treatment.

## Next Steps:

 Future work could include:

* Extending the tool to support additional data types.
* Developing more advanced visualization techniques.
* Integrating the tool with other bioinformatics tools.

## Acknowledgements

The development of this Master's Thesis and definitely this repository has been possible thanks to the invaluable support of the team of the research group of the Genomics Area of the Instituto Tecnológico y de Energías Renovables (ITER de Tenerife), in particular my external tutor José Miguel Lorenzo Salazar, for his invaluable guidance. This work would also not have been possible without the help of my UOC tutor, Dr. José Luis Mosquera Mayo, for his follow-up and valuable suggestions. To all of them, my sincere thanks.
